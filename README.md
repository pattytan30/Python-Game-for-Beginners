# Python-Game-for-Beginners

The project is a simple spaceship game developed with pygame on Python. This game is for users to control the spaceship with arrow keys from crashing into the falling cubes. Once the spaceship is escaped from the cubes, users can get points. The screen displays current scores and the highest score. The updated highest score will also be stored in a file along the game. If the user run the game again, the previous highest score will be shown on the screen. Along with the increasing score, the speed of falling cubes is also increased. There are five levels of speed in the setting. 

The program is written with Python 3.8, pygame 2.0.0.dev6, pip 20.0.2 in Pycharm environment.

### Running
Run the game using python main.py

The program will run by opening the main.py and clicking the “run” button of any programming environment. Once the program runs, the game will start automatically; and once the game is over, the system will exit automatically. I have tried to run this game from both PyCharm and IDLE. The experience of using PyCharm is of faster response. 

### Gameplay
The game supports left and right arrow keys to control the spaceship. 

### Load/Save
The highest score will be recorded and saved in bestscore.txt \
